Grep:
=====

Command to search by column
Eg, if the output is of the form 
a b c
1 1 1
2 1 1
2 2 1
and we want to search only 1 in 2nd column, then give the following command
cat hello | grep "^.\{2\}1"

Output:
$ cat hello | grep "^.\{2\}1"
1 1 1
2 1 1

^ - Begining of the line
. Match any character
\ - Escape caharcter
{2} - Skip 1st two characters
1 - Search for 1

Awk:
====

We can do a columnwise search with AWK easily.
a4 bugs -p EosKernel | awk '$2 == "eoskernel-dev"' gives the same result as above

Command to exclude comments from a file and print it
cat .config | grep -v '^$\|^\s*\#' | wc -l
